# The Floor is Lava

## Description

This demo is a free to play 2D platformer based of off the game the floor is lava. As a child, jumping/climing on furniture to avoiod touching the floor of your living room brought us many joyus memories, this game takes that fun concept and delivers it as a 2D platformer.
It works in such a way that  you have furniture like sofas, tables and bookshelves to jump on to to reach the finish flag. In addition to the furniture, this game has a stone floor that is available to jump on to help you navigate the lava. 
The secondary and optional part of the game is to find and clean up toys left on the furniture, If you touch the lava at all you will have to restart the game losing all progress, including collected toys. Collecting the toys is non-essential to completing the level.

This demo has been published on mega as a free download.
